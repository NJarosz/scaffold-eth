> Sipping Water Bottles!

This forks the OE40 branch, adapted for the teetotallers...

---


---

1. Mint WaterBottle NFTs (not sure if we want this to be free? Currently priced, on a curve)
2. You can sip from your Bottle NFT (only the owner can sip)
3. Sipping your NFT changes the amount of water left! (only 4 sips per Bottle)
4. Your address's number of sips is tracked, and if you add powder, you get extra HYDR per sip!
